# Senior-citizen-Identification
develop a machine learning model to predict multiple persons in a video or real-time webcam feed for a mall or local store. 

1.What This Project Will Do:
Detect faces from webcam/video using OpenCV.
Predict age and gender using a custom or pre-trained model.
If age > 60, mark the person as Senior Citizen.
Log their age, gender, and visit time to a CSV file.
(Optional) Add a GUI using tkinter or streamlit.

2.Technologies We'll Use (no TensorFlow):
OpenCV – for video feed and face detection
cvlib or deepface – for age/gender prediction
pandas – to save data
datetime – to log timestamp
tkinter (optional) – GUI for image/video feed

 


















3.Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
Step 1: Install Libraries
Step 2: Main Python Script (no GUI version)

Step 3: Output
Runs webcam feed and detects faces.
Predicts age & gender.
Marks "Senior" if age > 60.
Logs to senior_visits.csv.
